# Creating a PR

In your local copy of the respository, rename both your notebook and infographic to have the name of the stock ticker you're doing.

Put the infographic in the `stocks` directory, and the notebook in the `notebooks` directory.

Commit and push to your fork.

Next, navigate to your fork in the browser (for me it's `https://github.com/adityarathod/htf-research`, yours should be similar minus the username part).

Click the little "pull request" button:

Click "create pull request" again:

Title your PR in the exact same format, replacing "AAPL" with the stock you analyzed and then click Create pull request (description is optional):

This will create a PR into the main repository! Wait for it to be approved by us.

Once approved, it should show up on https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/profile. This counts as 1/4 pull requests!
