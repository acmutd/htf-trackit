# Challenge 6
Here are the two final examples for the workshop. These will be a bit more difficult than the previous ones.

# Search Engines
Your company wants to know how many people are getting to the site through search engines and which one is the most common search engine. Can you create a search that will display this information? Look at the info contained in the referer field.

# I Am Root
Security is concerned someone attempting to login to the webservers as root. Security logs use `sourcetype=secure`. Can you verify that there are attempts to login as root? How many attempts have their been? Try looking for logs with any mention of `root`.
