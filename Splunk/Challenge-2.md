# Challenge 2
In the first challenge, we told Splunk to seach for logs of a certian type by specifying the `sourcetype` field. Next, let's try to add more to our search.

## Searching for specific logs
In Splunk, we can search for a specific set of words in our logs. If we are looking for a log that says `IllegalArgumentException caught`, we can type that into the search field and search all of Splunk for a matching log.

Try searchig for `HTTP`, `GET`, or anything you like, and see how many search results come back.
