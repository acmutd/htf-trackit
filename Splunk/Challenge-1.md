# Challenge 1

Let's get comfortable with Splunk's search tool. Copy and paste this into the Splunk search bar.

```
sourcetype=access_combined_wcookie
```

Click on the gree search button or hit enter. Take some time to look through the results presented. These are all the Apache webserver logs for the time given in the search.

## Setting Time Range

To the left of the green search button, you should see a drop down menu.

Select a different time range. Does it change your results?
