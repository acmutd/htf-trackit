# What is the cloud?
Put simply, the cloud is a group of servers accessible over the internet.
Why do we need the cloud?

### Why do we need the cloud?
Companies who need to do large amounts of computation or need to make data accessible over the internet have traditionally had to host and maintain their own servers in a data center. Having to host data centers can get complicated, though:
 - Maintenance teams
 - Power outages
 - Internet speed
 - Scaling 

Cloud providers, on the other hand, specialize in hosting large datacenters with backups. Businesses can rent servers out of these dedicated cloud providers and focus on their product!
