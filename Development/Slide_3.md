# What is an API?

An **application programming interface** (API) is an interface designed for computers to interact with each other. APIs define the "code words" that one computer must say in order to convey messages to another computer.

# Web APIs

APIs are used everywhereâ€”especially on the internet. Web APIs help programmers design applications that talk to each other over the internet, and to allow other programmers use their projects!

In the case of web APIs, applications send requests to URLs that are defined in the API, called endpoints. They can also carry a data payload in order to make more specific requests or give data to the endpoint.

# Why should we use APIs?

 - Modular
 - Reduced overhead
 - Abstraction

# Examples

  - Google Calendar API
  - Discord API
  - Open Weather Map
